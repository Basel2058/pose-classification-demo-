# Simple Pose Classifier

This project demonstrates how to build a **simple human pose classifier** using [MediaPipe Pose](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/pose) for landmark detection and a basic scikit-learn model for classification.  

It was created as a junior-level project to showcase core skills in:
- Working with datasets
- Feature extraction from raw landmarks
- Training and evaluating ML models
- Saving and loading trained models
- Running a demo script for prediction

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses MediaPipe Pose to extract 33 body landmarks.
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier to distinguish **sitting vs standing**.
- Synthetic standing examples included (replace with your own dataset if available).
- Includes a ready-to-run demo (`demo.py`) that loads an image, overlays skeleton landmarks, and predicts the pose.
- Clean and simple codebase with comments for easy understanding.

## âš¡ Quickstart

### 1. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements include:
- mediapipe
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib

### 2. Train the model
```bash
python scripts/train_pose_classifier_synthetic.py
```

### 3. Run the demo
```bash
python scripts/demo.py --image path/to/your_image.jpg
```

Youâ€™ll see the skeleton drawn on the image with a prediction: **Sitting (xx.x%)** or **Standing (xx.x%)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Replace the synthetic standing examples with your own dataset for real performance.
- This repo is **designed for junior-level portfolios** â€” the focus is on clarity and showing that you can take a project end-to-end.
- Accuracy with synthetic data is ~99% (demo only).
